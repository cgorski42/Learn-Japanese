    <h1>A little about us:</h1>
    <p> This website is the pet project of two BYU students working on web programming. The goal of the site is to promote appreciation for the Japanese language and culture to all who are interested.</p>
    <!--p>Colin Gorski (input your stuff here, probably mention serving in Japan)<p-->
    <!--p>Benjamin Worlton is a senior studying Computer Science. He doesn't know a lot of Japanese, but has picked up bits and pieces from too much anime and is eager learn more. </p-->
    <!--p>Colin and Ben first met in their hometown of Bolingbrook, Illinois. They coincidentally ended up taking the same web programming class and decided to team up to create this website.<p-->
